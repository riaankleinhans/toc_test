# Brigade Archiving Review

As discussed in [Health of Brigade project](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/900), Brigade has no active maintainers and no contributors ready to become maintainers. The consensus in this issue was that we should suggest the project for archival.

In the [2022 Brigade Annual Review](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/reviews/2022-Brigade-annual.md), Brigade's core maintainers suggested that the project be archived, giving data to support this recommendation.

As per the [CNCF Project Archiving Process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/archiving.md), this archival proposal is now being PRed to the TOC repo.
