# Cloud Custodian

## Name of project

Cloud Custodian

## Project description

### Introduction

Cloud Custodian is a YAML DSL based stateless rules engine for cloud
audit, management, and governance.

Cloud Custodian exists as a policy/governance as code tool for
organizations to enable realtime detective controls to ensure that
organizational policies are being adhered to by their cloud
infrastructure. Policy/governance as code is about bringing some of
the best practices of software engineering to policy/governance,
ie. using version control, code review, testing, and continuous
integration and deployment tools.

Custodian can be used to manage AWS, Azure, and GCP environments by
ensuring real time compliance to security policies (like encryption
and access requirements), tag policies, operations best practices, and
cost management via garbage collection of unused resources and
off-hours resource management. Kubernetes and OpenStack support is
present in alpha stages at the moment.

Some of its features:
* Ability to implement detective controls to ensure adherence to organizational policies
* Supports real-time detection, reporting/notification, and remediation
* Consistent outputs and telemetry (blob, logs, trace, metrics) with provider native sinks.
* Minimal installation, usable as a cli query/investigative tool, or as an operations tool in a compliance as code environment.


### Intended Use

Custodian enables reusable vocabularies of filters and actions that
can be used to implement many semantic policies across hundreds of
resource types. For example an action like `stop` a vm instance could
be used for offhours savings, tag compliance, or incident
response. Some additional examples use cases might be

* Identify and Remediate load balancers or storage buckets not
  configured for logging
* Turning off development servers/clusters and databases off at night
  to realize cost savings.
* Finding underutilized resources and sending an email to their
  creator to reduce the size.
* Enforcing tag compliance policies on resources.
* Finding resources with embedded access control policies that are
  setup to give access across the org boundary.
* In response to a security event, used as a remediation tool to
  snapshot, disk, network isolate a server, change cloud credentials,
  and install forensics tools.
